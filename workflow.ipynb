    "1. Выбрать два 7-10 минутных видео на английском языке (TED talk/интервью/...) с мужским и женским голосом\n",
    "2. Выполнить предобработку данных: выделить аудио, сегментировать, привести к нужному  для ASR модели формату, при необходимости применить деноизинг\n",
    "3. Запустить любые open-source ASR и MT модели. Объяснить выбор моделей.\n",
    "4. Разобраться в архитектуре модели XTTS https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.04904 \n",
    "5. Zero-shot voice cloning: \n",
    "   - скопировать репозиторий https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS\n",
    "   - сгенерировать аудио для соответствующих текстов на русском языке аудио моделью XTTSv2. В качестве промпта подавать исходные записи на английском для копирования голоса \n",
    "   - наложить аудио на видео\n",
    "6. Few-shot voice cloning:  \n",
    "   - выбрать голос персонажа/актера, на котором zero-shot генерация дает не совсем точное копирование/не передает специфические характеристики, и собрать аудиозаписи для него\n",
    "   - выполнить файнтюнинг модели на этих данных (проверить на разном количестве данных, подобрать гиперпараметры при необходимости)\n",
    "   - сгенерировать те же предложения до и после файнтюнинга\n",
    "   - посчитать объективную метрику похожести голоса (speaker smilarity): косинусное расстояние между векторами модели исходной (gt) и сгенерированной записи для zero- и few-shot вариантов\n",

    "Результат представить:\n",
    "  - в виде ноутбука с поэтапным описанием каждого шага/ скриптов\n",
    "  - описания XTTS модели, основных компонент архитектуры и их задач. описание того, какие части обновляются во время few-shot клонирования\n",

    "My name is Cameron Diaz. I'm 41 years old. I'm my weight of 42. I am an actor and film. I recently just wrote a book called The Body Book, co-authored with a wonderful writing partner named Sondra Park. And I grew up in Long Beach, California. I live in Los Angeles and New York. I go back and forth, but I like the seasons. And what else do I need to tell you? That's, I think, that's it, right? Okay. If one people... I like the seasons, and what else do I need to tell you? That's, I think that's it, right? Okay. When people say, oh, I want to be like you, I want to be an actor, I want to look like you. The question I always ask them is why? Like really why? And people, and especially America, this idea of fame, that to be famous means that you're successful, that you're happy. It's not about, I don't do what I do because I want to be famous. That's part of being famous is my job. That's, when I'm home, I am not, and I'm with my family and my friends. I am not famous, I am me, and I'm Cameron, and that doesn't, fame does not define me. And so if you are looking for fame to define you, then you will never be happy and you will always be searching for happiness and you will never find it in fame. And so it goes back to I think for me, authenticity, intention. Why do you want to do anything you do? It should not be motivated by something that you think is going to make fulfillment comes from within you by being authentic to yourself, not chasing fame. I was really fortunate, the education that I got from my parents was really an amazing, I was so lucky to have just the best parents who really trusted and empowered and they just gave us everything. There was an moment where my parents weren't teaching us. They were always teaching us, very actively teaching us, work ethic, how to be a good person, how to treat people, how to be a good human being. That was a very important thing to them. And there was always lessons, always lessons. And I think that they just loved with every part of their being. They loved us so deeply and that I think is just to know what it feels like to be loved, to know how to love and how to be loved is such an important thing. They really showed us, my sister and I, how to, you know, how to do that. When my father died, the moment we need to not knowing what that meant, not knowing what it would mean to be without him, I think was probably the hardest moment, and to have to see my mother have to say goodbye to him. and oh, just really hard and all the family but yeah I think that that moment of not knowing really was so painful and then after that knowing that and learning the lessons like being very soon like the next morning when I woke up and I was I had a I had this had this moment where I was like, oh my god, my dad is dead. Like he's dead. He's gone. And I had this moment where I had a visual of my dad standing next to me. And all of a sudden, I looked over and he was gone. And there was this massive hole, this huge, huge hole that was so deep I couldn't see the end of it, it was so dark, it was so overwhelming and on the other side of that hole was this massive pile of dirt. It was so high, I couldn't see the top of it. And I instinctively, I went, I walked around the hole, I saw myself walking around the hole and I started, I rolled up my sleeves and I started climbing through the dirt. And as soon as I dug my hand into the dirt, I pulled my hand out, and there was strands of emeralds and rubies, and in this hand was a gold goblet, and I was so perplexed for a moment, and I just immediately all of this, and I realized, Okay, where he once was is now this, he has left me a task, a responsibility that I must climb up this pile of dirt that seems so overwhelming. And I must dig out all of the treasures that he's left behind, all of the jewels, all of the lessons, all of the things that are going to enrich my life. And I just saw myself climbing through it and I'm still climbing up to the top. And I've gotten so many, he's left me so many beautiful treasures. So."

When my father died, the moment we need to not knowing what that meant, not knowing what it would mean to be without him, I think was probably the hardest moment, and to have to see my mother have to say goodbye to him. and oh, just really hard and all the family but yeah I think that that moment of not knowing really was so painful and then after that knowing that and learning the lessons like being very soon like the next morning when I woke up and I was I had a I had this had this moment where I was like, oh my god, my dad is dead. Like he's dead. He's gone. And I had this moment where I had a visual of my dad standing next to me. And all of a sudden, I looked over and he was gone. And there was this massive hole, this huge, huge hole that was so deep I couldn't see the end of it, it was so dark, it was so overwhelming and on the other side of that hole was this massive pile of dirt. It was so high, I couldn't see the top of it. And I instinctively, I went, I walked around the hole, I saw myself walking around the hole and I started, I rolled up my sleeves and I started climbing through the dirt. And as soon as I dug my hand into the dirt, I pulled my hand out, and there was strands of emeralds and rubies, and in this hand was a gold goblet, and I was so perplexed for a moment, and I just immediately all of this, and I realized, Okay, where he once was is now this, he has left me a task, a responsibility that I must climb up this pile of dirt that seems so overwhelming. And I must dig out all of the treasures that he's left behind, all of the jewels, all of the lessons, all of the things that are going to enrich my life. And I just saw myself climbing through it and I'm still climbing up to the top. And I've gotten so many, he's left me so many beautiful treasures. So.\""

       "{'text': \" My name is Cameron Diaz. I'm 41 years old. I'm my weight of 42. I am an actor and film. I recently just wrote a book called The Body Book, co-authored with a wonderful writing partner named Sondra Park. And I grew up in Long Beach, California. I live in Los Angeles and New York. I go back and forth, but I like the seasons. And what else do I need to tell you? That's, I think, that's it, right? Okay. If one people... If one people... If one people... If one people... If one people... If one people... If one people... If one people... If one people... If one people... If one people... If one people... If one people... If one people... If one people... If one people... If one people... If one people... If one people... If one people... If one people... If one people... If one people... If one people... If one people... If one people... If one people... I like the seasons, and what else do I need to tell you? That's, I think that's it, right? Okay. When people say, oh, I want to be like you, I want to be an actor, I want to look like you. The question I always ask them is why? Like really why? And people, and especially America, this idea of fame, that to be famous means that you're successful, that you're happy. It's not about, I don't do what I do. It's not about, I don't do what I do. It's not about, I don't do what I do. It's not about, I don't do what I do. It's not about, I don't do what I do. It's not about, I don't do what I do. It's not about, I don't do what I do. It's not about, I don't do what I do. It's not about, I don't do what I do. It's not about, I don't do what I do. It's not about, I don't do what I do. It's not about, I don't do what I do. It's not about, I don't do what I do. It's not about, I don't do what I do. It's not about, I don't do what I do. It's not about, I don't do what I do. It's not about, I don't do what I do. It's not about, I don't do what I do. It's not about, I don't do what I do. It's not about, I don't do what I do. It's not about, I don't do what I do. It's not about, I don't do what I do. It's not about, I don't do what I do. It's not about, I don't do what I do. It's not about, I don't do what I do. It's not about, I don't do what I do. It's not about, I don't that you're happy. It's not about, I don't do what I do because I want to be famous. That's part of being famous is my job. That's, when I'm home, I am not, and I'm with my family and my friends. I am not famous, I am me, and I'm Cameron, and that doesn't, fame does not define me. And so, if you are looking for fame to define you, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry and I'm Cameron and that doesn't, fame does not define me. And so if you are looking for fame to define you, then you will never be happy and you will always be searching for happiness and you will never find it in fame. And so it goes back to I think for me, authenticity, intention. Why do you want to do anything you do? It should not be motivated by something that you want to do, anything you do. It should not be motivated by something that you back to, I think, for me, authenticity, intention. Why do you want to do anything you do? It should not be motivated by something that you think is going to make fulfillment comes from within you by being authentic to yourself, not chasing fame. I was really fortunate, the education that I got from my parents was really an amazing, I was so lucky to have just the best parents to really... I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

       "\" My name is Cameron Diaz. I'm 41 years old. I'm my weight of 42. I am an actor and film. I recently just wrote a book called The Body Book, co-authored with a wonderful writing partner named Sondra Park. And I grew up in Long Beach, California. I live in Los Angeles and New York. I go back and forth, but I like the seasons. And what else do I need to tell you? That's, I think, that's it, right? Okay. If one people... I like the seasons, and what else do I need to tell you? That's, I think that's it, right? Okay. When people say, oh, I want to be like you, I want to be an actor, I want to look like you. The question I always ask them is why? Like really why? And people, and especially America, this idea of fame, that to be famous means that you're successful, that you're happy. It's not about, I don't do what I do because I want to be famous. That's part of being famous is my job. That's, when I'm home, I am not, and I'm with my family and my friends. I am not famous, I am me, and I'm Cameron, and that doesn't, fame does not define me. And so if you are looking for fame to define you, then you will never be happy and you will always be searching for happiness and you will never find it in fame. And so it goes back to I think for me, authenticity, intention. Why do you want to do anything you do? It should not be motivated by something that you think is going to make fulfillment comes from within you by being authentic to yourself, not chasing fame. I was really fortunate, the education that I got from my parents was really an amazing, I was so lucky to have just the best parents who really trusted and empowered and they just gave us everything. There was an moment where my parents weren't teaching us. They were always teaching us, very actively teaching us, work ethic, how to be a good person, how to treat people, how to be a good human being. That was a very important thing to them. And there was always lessons, always lessons. And I think that they just loved with every part of their being. They loved us so deeply and that I think is just to know what it feels like to be loved, to know how to love and how to be loved is such an important thing. They really showed us, my sister and I, how to, you know, how to do that. When my father died, the moment we need to not knowing what that meant, not knowing what it would mean to be without him, I think was probably the hardest moment, and to have to see my mother have to say goodbye to him. and oh, just really hard and all the family but yeah I think that that moment of not knowing really was so painful and then after that knowing that and learning the lessons like being very soon like the next morning when I woke up and I was I had a I had this had this moment where I was like, oh my god, my dad is dead. Like he's dead. He's gone. And I had this moment where I had a visual of my dad standing next to me. And all of a sudden, I looked over and he was gone. And there was this massive hole, this huge, huge hole that was so deep I couldn't see the end of it, it was so dark, it was so overwhelming and on the other side of that hole was this massive pile of dirt. It was so high, I couldn't see the top of it. And I instinctively, I went, I walked around the hole, I saw myself walking around the hole and I started, I rolled up my sleeves and I started climbing through the dirt. And as soon as I dug my hand into the dirt, I pulled my hand out, and there was strands of emeralds and rubies, and in this hand was a gold goblet, and I was so perplexed for a moment, and I just immediately all of this, and I realized, Okay, where he once was is now this, he has left me a task, a responsibility that I must climb up this pile of dirt that seems so overwhelming. And I must dig out all of the treasures that he's left behind, all of the jewels, all of the lessons, all of the things that are going to enrich my life. And I just saw myself climbing through it and I'm still climbing up to the top. And I've gotten so many, he's left me so many beautiful treasures. So.\""

And let's go straight into it whilst I enjoy this California dream gin and tonic.

I had the, the the animal sanctuary is something we've talked about as a TV show which I think is fascinating as an idea I had the the neighbors would hate this but in the village where I spend some of my time in Wiltshire near where the pub is and I had the idea that because I've got this field it's really it's really a garden but it's a field but it's not an agricultural field and it's on a bit of a slope and it has some woodland I thought well I could have a a donkey or two, or a couple of goats, because they're very interesting. So, I'm going to give you a little bit of an example of what we're going to do here. So, I'm going to give you a little bit of an example of what we're going to do here.

I thought well I could have a donkey or two or a couple of goats because they're very entertaining and I like talking to animals and then we sort of thought well what if we got everybody in the village to start adopting animals and you know every house would have some ducks or rabbits or a cat or a dog or maybe if they had a bit of bit of garden they could have an an unwanted horse or a tarp.................................... house would have some ducks or rabbits or a cat or a dog or maybe if they had a bit of bit of garden they could have an unwanted horse or a tired old cow or something like that and then it would become Animal Village and then we'd have to stop people driving through it or they'd have to be escorted through it because the place would be overrun with animals and we could talk to them all and save them and and and commune with them and it would be just brilliant but Then, of course, because it would be a TV show, it would last for maybe... It would last for maybe... It would last for maybe... It would last for maybe... It would last for maybe... It would last for maybe... It would last for maybe... It would last for maybe...

The thing about domesticated animals, I think. Wild animals are very different.................................... they are sentient and they they need care. The thing about domesticated animals, I think wild animals are very different but domesticated animals are the way they are because we've made them that way. We have bred them to the point where they can't be self-sufficient and look after themselves, they can't be released into the wild. Therefore we have a moral duty to care for them because if we We don't, we diminish ourselves as humans. We don't. We diminish ourselves as humans. We don't. We diminish ourselves as humans. We don't. We diminish ourselves as humans. We don't. We diminish ourselves as humans. We don't. We diminish ourselves as humans. We don't. We diminish ourselves as humans. We don't.

We diminish ourselves as humans. We don't. We diminish ourselves as humans. We don't, we diminish ourselves as humans. Which is why I feel very attached to domesticated animals. I don't just mean pets, I also mean things like sheep and goats and cows. I never know, I mean I spend a lot of time studying my cat who's, with the best one in the world, a bit dim and I try to work out if there's anything going on in his head or if he even really knows me or if I'm just a source of warmth. I might just be a source of warmth, he may just be a temperature and moisture activated mechanism who happens to have quite a cute little furry face and there's some mildly amusing things............................................................................... a temperature and moisture activated mechanism who happens to have quite the cute little furry face and does some mildly amusing things occasionally. I often think that if I became two inches tall suddenly my cat who appears to love me would actually kill me for his own entertainment because I'd be like that ping pong ball that he likes chasing around or a mouse. Not that he ever catches a mouse because he's fat and useless but you know what I mean. So, animal welfare is............................................................................................................. Because I'd be like that ping pong ball that he likes chasing around, or a mouse. Not that he ever catches a mouse because he's fat and useless, but you know what I mean. So animal welfare is a difficult one because we eat animals, I eat animals, I think they should be dispatched humanely, but ultimately if you take the view that the welfare of animals is important, you'd have to come to the conclusion that we shouldn't kill them and eat them........................ But ultimately, if you take the view that the welfare of animals is important, you'd have to come to the conclusion that we shouldn't kill them and eat them. And I struggled with that one a bit. Have you ever been tempted to be vegetarian? I did try it. I tried it. I kept it up for about nine months, but to be brutally honest, it made me ill. I did actually end up in hospital because my guts couldn't cope with it cope with it, and became inflamed and......................................................... it made me ill. I did actually end up in hospital because my guts couldn't cope with it and became inflamed and it was quite dangerous. So I love the idea of it. I can, although I don't really know anything about this, I can imagine a future where humans don't eat animals anymore and it may be one of those things we look back on, the way we look back on slavery and child labour.

They'll say do you know what they used to do in the old days? They used to eat animals. Do you talk to your cats? Yes I talk to all animals. I had a very long conversation with the horse a little while back when I say conversation I talked at the horse and the horse took a big dump while I I was talking to. I was talking to her.

I was a very long conversation with a horse a little while back when I say conversation. I talked at the horse and the horse took a big dump while I was talking to it. But I said, I thought everybody talked to animals. It's perfectly normal, isn't it? You want, obviously, you know, my cat's called Bancer and I talked to him and the only word he possibly understands is Bancer. The rest of it is just bleh, as far as he can say. I know he can't speak. And I remember writing this in a column I did years ago. And I remember writing this in a column I did years ago. And I remember writing this in a column I did years ago.

I know he can't speak. And I remember writing this in a column I did years ago about another cat we had is that he was equipped with everything you need to speak. So to speak, you need a voice box and you need a tongue and teeth, you know, how these things move around, form all the sounds that we use to make words. And he's got all those, so he could, technically............................................................................................................................................................ and teeth, you know, how these things move around form all the sounds that we use to make words. And he's got all those, so he could technically talk. But he doesn't talk, he only goes and makes bleating noises when he wants some food or he wants to be picked up and cuddled. And my conclusion was, and I can't argue my way out of my own conclusion, the reason the cat and the The dog and the horse don't talk, is because they don't have any................................................................................. And I can't argue my way out of my own conclusion, the reason the cat and the dog and the horse don't talk is because they don't have anything to say. I think you're right, most people do speak to animals, but by your own conclusion, you don't think they understand us. So why do you think everyone speaks to them anyway? Because the main purpose, I think of pets especially, is to make us feel better. y'all you you everyone speaks to them anyway. Because the main purpose I think of pets especially is is to make us feel better. They are, Sarah my other half put it very nicely, she says they're hairy or furry reminders of human neediness and there is something about that. But at the same time I also think there is, well, two things I admire in animals, their state of complete bliss, especially say a sleeping cat or a cow or a horse just munching on some grass in a field on a nice day or sheep running around the hills. I mean, it is a state of pure bliss. It's the absence of care. They have nothing to worry about apart from finding a bit of a bit of grass. So I think we'd like to thank you very much.

I think we like that in the animals and we project it backwards and forwards. We envy their lifestyle in many ways and we sort of wish we could be, well, that oblivious. That's how it appears to us in many ways. But at the same time I So I think you can, although animals don't understand. So I think you can, although animals don't understand. So I think you can, although animals don't understand. So I think you can, although animals don't understand. So I think you can, although animals don't understand. So I think you can, although animals don't understand. So I think you can, although animals don't understand. So I think you can, although animals don't understand. So I think you can, although animals don't understand. So I think you can, although animals don't understand. So I think you can, although animals don't understand. So I think you can, although animals don't understand. So I think you can, although animals ways but at the same time I think you can although animals don't understand words certain animals do seem to understand I mean dogs especially understand your emotions they know when you're unhappy or scared. Horses know when you're scared. They take advantage of it, don't they? I've been thrown from a horse because the horse knew that I didn't really like being on the horse. Because I love horses and talking to horses and rubbing their noses, but I don't like sitting on them. I just think that's an absolutely mad idea. Why would you do that? It's got a brain of its own and it's only about that big. So there is something going on, but we don't quite understand what it is. and it's possibly best that we don't, because that keeps.......................................................................... It's got a brain of its own and it's only about that big. So there is something going on, but we don't quite understand what it is. And it's possibly best that we don't because that keeps the mystery of the relationship alive. Yeah, so it might be thinking the same about you. It could be. I mean, I once thought, what if there's a horse? I mean, we imagine the horses are sort of quite simple souls really, but there's a horse in a field or a cow Bunching away at the grass. Bunching away at the grass. Bunching away at the grass. Bunching away at the grass. Bunching away at the grass. Bunching away at the grass. Bunching away at the grass. Bunching away at the grass. Bunching away at the grass. Bunching away at the grass. Bunching away at the grass. Bunching away at the grass. Bunching away at the grass. Bunching away at the grass. Bunching away at the grass. Bunching away at the grass. Bunching away at the grass. I mean, we imagine the horses are sort of quite simple soles really, but there's a horse in a field or a cow bunching away at the grass, sun shining down on its back and it's all nice and that horse invents the separate condenser steam engine. This happened a few hundred years ago. The horse suddenly thinks Shit, I think I've got it. That bloke Newcomen has come up with this engine but he hasn't quite got it right because it relies on atmospheric pressure. It should actually be the steam pressure and it should have a a separate condenser. It's a separate condenser. It's a separate condenser. It's a separate condenser. It's a separate condenser. It's a separate condenser. It's a separate condenser. It's a separate condenser. It's a separate condenser. It's a separate condenser. It's a separate condenser. It's a separate condenser. It's a separate condenser. It's a separate condenser. It's a separate condenser. It's a separate condenser. It's a separate condenser. It's a separate condenser. It's a separate condenser. It's a separate condenser. It's a separate condenser. It's a separate condenser. It's a separate condenser. It's a separate condenser. It's a separate condenser. It's a separate condenser. It's a this engine, but he hasn't quite got it right because it relies on atmospheric pressure. It should actually be the steam pressure and it should have a separate condenser. And he thinks all that and then he remembers, no, I'm a horse and I can't hold a pen. So I can't write it down. I can't explain it to anybody because I can't speak and I can't make it because I don't have opposed thumbs of any got hooves. So it just stays in the mind of the horse. I mean, cats and dogs may I'll be working on the................................. because I don't have opposed thumbs I've only got hooves so it just stays in the mind of the horse. I mean cats and dogs may be working on the libretti for fabulous operas or musical comedies or something but we don't know because they can't unlock it. What if, I mean cats especially that you know who go out and wander around by themselves, what if they all get together in some secret place in the neighborhood. And....................................................................................... What if, I mean cats especially, who go out and wander around by themselves, what if they all get together in some secret place in the neighbourhood and they're discussing who's got some nice chicken left over bits that you might be able to scrounge or who's got a warm bonnet on their car to go and lie on. Or they might be plotting something much bigger. Or they might all be playing in jazz bands because you sort of imagine, you imagine that cats are in jazz bands and dogs are in rock bands. hands.
